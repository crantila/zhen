- search improvements
    - implement full-text searching (see below)
    - adjust the SQL queries to use JOINs so that you can have only one query
- split classifiers by traditional/simplified and handle accordingly
- deduplicate the "define" and "characters" templates
- make sure classifier search links show up on both "define" and "characters" templates
- do some sort of input validation on the word being looked up
- use progressive enhancement to load results with AJAX when possible
- add a ServiceWorker to cache the app shell for offline
- amend the ServiceWorker to cache dictionary results too


NOTES for full-text search:
- refer to https://sqlite.org/fts3.html
- must use FTS3 because OpenShift
- remove the "word_lowercase" field from the "english" table
- should run the "optimize" command after INSERTing everything
   INSERT INTO xyz(xyz) VALUES('optimize');
- should restructure the tables for many-to-many before doing the FTS
