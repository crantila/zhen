- search improvements
    - make it search for substrings (e.g., searching for "find" should also bring results for "to find")
    - make it case insensitive
- split classifiers by traditional/simplified and handle accordingly
- deduplicate the "define" and "characters" templates
- make sure classifier search links show up on both "define" and "characters" templates
- do some sort of input validation on the word being looked up
- adjust SQL query for English so you only have to run one query
- see if there's a way to make a one-to-many FOREIGN KEY
- use progressive enhancement to load results with AJAX when possible
- add a ServiceWorker to cache the app shell for offline
- amend the ServiceWorker to cache dictionary results too
